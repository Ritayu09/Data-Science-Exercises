## Data Mining and Classification Model on Medical Records Data

The project involved data analysis on medical data record where the task at hand was to build a machine learning model to classify whether a person has a disease or not.

In subsequent part (Part 2), the project involved further training the model to identify the type of disease as well by making a multi-class problem.
